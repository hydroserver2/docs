# HydroServer Web Application

In order to make data management as convenient as possible, we've built a web application that
allows you to manage your data stored in HydroServer as well as view and download public data from other users.

The beta instance is live at:

https://beta.hydroserver2.org

## Browse Public Sites

Publicly available sites can be browsed at:

https://beta.hydroserver2.org/browse

There you'll see a map with the locations of monitoring sites. Selecting one will allow you to navigate
to a details page for that site where you'll see the associated datastreams and data in sparkline plots.
Feel free to interact with and download the data to get a feel for the website.

## Manage Your Sites

After creating an account and verifying your email, you'll be able to navigate to the 'My Sites' page,
where you'll see an empty map that will be populated with your sites as you create them. You'll see a button labeled
'REGISTER A NEW SITE' which will open a modal window for inputting the location and details of your site.
Once created, you'll be able to navigate to the sites details page either from clicking the newly created
marker on the map, or the entry in the "My Registered Sites" table.

From there, you'll see various buttons for managing the site details, adding other owners, and creating datastreams.
